The Minecraft launcher keeps logs of game events as they happen which can be useful for debugging errors or other issues that may occur within the game.

The latest log begins logging after Minecraft successfuly launches. Sometimes error messages are logged there and are helpful in troubleshooting certain errors and crashes that happen in-game.

# Instructions

Step 1

Start Minecraft and run it to the point where the crash/error occurs. Then close Minecraft and keep it closed.

Step 2

Locate your .minecraft folder. The process is different whether you’re using Windows, macOS or Linux.

Windows
